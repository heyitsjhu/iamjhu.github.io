  <h2 class="notes__heading">Knowledge Should Be Free</h2>
  <p class="notes__text">Below is a collection of notes I've taken in my continued pursuit to becoming a web developer. I find some topics harder to understand than others and the act of note-taking helps me retain more of that information. I can also refer back to these notes to refresh my memory when I need it. Hopefully, these notes can prove useful to others who are just learning how to program, as well. This is one of the reasons why I made them available hereâ€”and why I love open-source. Knowledge should be free.</p>
